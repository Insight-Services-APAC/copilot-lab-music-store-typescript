# Welcome to the GitHub Copilot Lab

This lab is designed to help you get started with Node.js, Express, Next.js, and TypeScript, all while learning how to use GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code.

## Introduction

In this lab, you will be building a Single Page Application (SPA) music store. You will be creating an API using Node.js and Express, and a web application using Next.js. Throughout the process, you will be guided by GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered code assistant that can help you write better code faster.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the lab, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js
- Visual Studio Code
- GitHub Copilot extension for VS Code

Basic knowledge of JavaScript and TypeScript is recommended.

## Getting Stuck?

If you find yourself stuck at any point during the lab, remember to ask questions to GitHub Copilot in the chat. It's there to help you!

However, if you're really stuck, you can take a peek at the finished solution here: [https://github.com/ollief87/copilot-lab-music-store-typescript-complete](https://github.com/ollief87/copilot-lab-music-store-typescript-complete). But remember, try to figure it out on your own first. The real learning happens when you're solving problems yourself!

Happy coding!
